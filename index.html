        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This concept envisions a lightweight drone system capable of autonomously detecting and
            harvesting tea leaves using an AI-powered vision system. Each drone is equipped with a
            high-resolution camera or sensor, a small robotic cutter or plucking mechanism, and a lightweight
            bag to collect harvested leaves.
        </p>
        <p>
            The drone identifies suitable tea leaves, cuts or plucks them, and stores them in its onboard
            collection bag. Once full, the drone autonomously returns to a central collection station to offload the
            leaves before resuming its task.
        </p>
        <p>
            Multiple drones operate together in a swarm-like manner, inspired by the behavior of <b>bees collecting
                nectar.</b> They are coordinated by a central wireless program that manages flight paths, load levels,
            and coverage areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            This system is designed to be energy-efficient, scalable, and capable of operating across large tea
            plantations, reducing human labor while ensuring precision harvesting.

    <div class="section" id="challenges">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>

        <h3>1. AI Leaf Detection Accuracy</h3>
        <p>
            Training an AI model to reliably identify mature tea leaves in varied lighting and weather conditions
            requires a large, well-labeled dataset. Accuracy must be high to avoid harvesting immature or damaged
            leaves, which could reduce tea quality.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Precision Harvesting Mechanism</h3>
        <p>
            Designing a lightweight yet effective plucking or cutting tool is technically challenging. The mechanism
            must be delicate enough not to harm the plant while being durable and efficient in repetitive action.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Power and Battery Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            Drones require sufficient power to fly, process AI computations, and operate harvesting tools. Balancing
            flight time with payload and operational power is a major engineering hurdle.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Swarm Coordination</h3>
        <p>
            Managing multiple drones simultaneously without collisions or redundant coverage demands a robust central
            coordination system and reliable real-time communication. Swarm logic needs to be fault-tolerant and
            efficient.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Field Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance</h3>
        <p>
            Navigating complex terrain, varying plant heights, and unpredictable obstacles like birds or weather
            conditions requires a combination of sensors (e.g., LiDAR, ultrasonic, vision) and intelligent pathfinding
            algorithms.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Central Hub Design</h3>
        <p>
            Creating an efficient central collection and charging station that allows quick and automated unloading and
            recharging while handling many drones is a significant system design task.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Cost and Scalability</h3>
        <p>
            Initial costs for AI hardware, drone prototyping, and software development may be high. Making the system
            affordable for widespread adoption in tea plantations, especially in developing regions, is a key challenge.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Weather Dependency</h3>
        <p>
            Tea plantations often experience varying weather conditions such as rain, wind, or fog, which can interfere
            with flight, vision detection, and harvesting accuracy. Developing a weather-resilient system adds
            complexity.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Regulatory and Safety Concerns</h3>
        <p>
            Autonomous drones operating in agricultural spaces must comply with aviation regulations and safety
            standards. Ensuring safe deployment without legal issues requires careful planning and certifications.
