# AI-Powered Tea Leaf Harvesting Drone Swarm (Public Domain Concept)

<img src="img/img2.jpg">

This project presents an open and publicly documented concept for an autonomous tea leaf harvesting system using AI-powered lightweight drones. These drones can detect and pluck tea leaves, collect them in small bags, and return to a central hub for unloading before continuing the process. The system operates as a coordinated swarm, similar to how bees collect nectar, all managed by a central wireless control system.
